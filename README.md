<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is part of my self-taught deep learning journey, where Iâ€™ve built and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch using PyTorch. The goal was to understand the entire training pipelineâ€”data preprocessing, model architecture, training loops, evaluation, and optimizationâ€”without relying on high-level abstractions or pre-trained models.

The project includes the implementation and training of two key models:

1. ResNet-20 for CIFAR-10
A classic deep residual network, implemented from the ground up and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This model follows the architecture and training procedure described in the original ResNet paper, including data augmentation, multi-step learning rate scheduling, and weight decay.

2. Custom CNN on a Kaggle Open Dataset
A second model trained on an open-source dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruhulaminsharif/eye-disease-image-dataset), showcasing flexibility in applying deep learning fundamentals to a different, real-world dataset. This part of the project involved adapting preprocessing steps and tuning hyperparameters based on the unique characteristics of the dataset.

ðŸ“š What I Learned:

- Building CNN architectures (including residual blocks) from scratch
- Dataset handling with torchvision and custom transformations
- Training & evaluation loops using DataLoader, loss functions, and optimizers
- Learning rate scheduling, TensorBoard logging, and model checkpointing
- Model performance analysis and iterative tuning

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```

3. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project

   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
